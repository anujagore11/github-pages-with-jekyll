Like many other techies out there, Google has been my dream company right from the beginning. When I cleared the Google interview this time, many of my friends reached out to me for tips and guidance for their upcoming interviews. During these conversations I started identifying patterns and felt like it might be worth documenting these since I know the struggle of interviewing in and out by now. Its a tough process and can get a bit strenuous at times specially if you are working a full time job.
